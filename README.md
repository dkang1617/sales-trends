# sales-trends

This is a project where I created a mock database with three tables, movies, theaters, and sales. There are two programs that both achieve the same end-goal: Find the best-selling theater for a given day.
The Python file utilizes psycopg2 to connect with the PostgreSQL table, and queries it to find the correct answer.
